🕵️‍♀️ Fraud Detection Project
📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. 
Fraudulent data is typically highly imbalanced, which makes it a challenging classification problem. 
This project explores methods for handling class imbalance and building a model that can accurately identify fraud cases.

📂 Dataset
Source: [Insert source here, e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset]

Features: Various anonymized transaction featur🛠️ Preprocessing Steps
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (if any)

Normalized the Amount feature

Handling Imbalance:

Used undersampling to balance the dataset by reducing the majority class

Optionally: We can use SMOTE or RandomOverSampler (see imbalanced-learn)

Feature Engineering:

Dropped irrelevant columns (Time, etc. if needed)

Standardized feature valueses (e.g., V1 to V28, Amount, Time)

Target Column: Class

0 = Legitimate

1 = Fraudulent

Class Imbalance:

Legitimate: ~99.8%

Fraudulent: ~0.2%

🧠 Future Improvements
Use deep learning models (LSTM, Autoencoders)

Try ensemble techniques like VotingClassifier

Tune hyperparameters for better performance

Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit
